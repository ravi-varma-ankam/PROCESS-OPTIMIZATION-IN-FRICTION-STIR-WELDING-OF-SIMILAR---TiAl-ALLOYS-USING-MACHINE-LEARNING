# PROCESS OPTIMIZATION IN FRICTION STIR WELDING OF SIMILAR γ - TiAl ALLOYS USING MACHINE LEARNING
Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has emerged as a promising solid-state welding technique for advanced materials, particularly in the aerospace industry where γ-TiAl alloys are   increasingly employed due to their exceptional high-temperature strength-to-weight ratios. This research focuses on the process optimization of FSW for joining two similar γ-TiAl alloys.

Friction Stir Welding (FSW) stands out as a promising technique for joining advanced materials, especially in the context of γ-TiAl alloys, owing to its ability to mitigate thermal distortion and preserve material properties. This research focuses on the process optimization of FSW for welding two similar γ-TiAl alloys, aiming to enhance the tensile strength of the welded joints. The optimization process involves the identification and refinement of key welding parameters, such as tool rotational speed, traverse speed, and axial force.

By leveraging ML algorithms, a predictive model is developed to estimate tensile strength based on the selected welding parameters. This research contributes to the field by showcasing the efficiency of machine learning in predicting tensile strength in FSW of similar γ-TiAl alloys.
